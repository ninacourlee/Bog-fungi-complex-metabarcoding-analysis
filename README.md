# Bog-fungi-complex-metabarcoding-analysis
Code for analyzing fungal community composition and structure in raised bogs using an integrated approach combining metabarcoding and classical observational methods.
The community analysis was performed in the Google Colab environment using data processing packages (pandas, numpy, scipy), visualization tools (matplotlib, seaborn), bioinformatics libraries (scikit-bio), progress monitoring (tqdm), and other auxiliary libraries.
