# Bog-fungi-complex-metabarcoding-analysis
Code for analyzing fungal community composition and structure in raised bogs using an integrated approach combining metabarcoding and classical observational methods.
The community analysis was performed in the Google Colab environment using data processing packages (pandas, numpy, scipy), visualization tools (matplotlib, seaborn), bioinformatics libraries (scikit-bio), progress monitoring (tqdm), and other auxiliary libraries.

**About the project**
Filippova N, Zvyagina E, Rudykina EA, Ishmanov TF, Filippov IV, Bulyonkova TM, Dobrynina AS (2024) DNA-based occurrence dataset on peatland fungal communities studied by metabarcoding in north-western Siberia. Biodiversity Data Journal 12: e119851. https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.12.e119851

**How to use the script**
1) Download primary data (data.csv, metadata.csv, checklist.csv /data folder in this repository)
2) Load and run ipynb in Google Colabs or othe environment
3) Generated figures and tables are available in outpub
