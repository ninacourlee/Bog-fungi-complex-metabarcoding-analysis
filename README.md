# Bog-fungi-complex-metabarcoding-analysis
Code for analyzing fungal community composition and structure in raised bogs using an integrated approach combining metabarcoding and classical observational methods.
The community analysis was performed in the Google Colab environment using data processing packages (pandas, numpy, scipy), visualization tools (matplotlib, seaborn), bioinformatics libraries (scikit-bio), progress monitoring (tqdm), and other auxiliary libraries.

**About the project**

Filippova N, Zvyagina E, Rudykina EA, Ishmanov TF, Filippov IV, Bulyonkova TM, Dobrynina AS (2024) DNA-based occurrence dataset on peatland fungal communities studied by metabarcoding in north-western Siberia. Biodiversity Data Journal 12: e119851. https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.12.e119851

**How to use the script**
1) Download primary data (data.csv, metadata.csv, checklist.csv /data folder in this repository)
2) Load and run Bog fun meta analysis.ipynb in Google Colabs or other environment
3) Generated figures and tables are available in outpub

**Data storage**

Note: Data updates will only occur via GBIF repository
